    				Whether by instinct or holy premonition, you know one of those near you is going to die. 
    				You only have five minutes to uncover the killer, the victim and location. 
    				Can you be the hero? Or will you fail miserably...

    				This is the first game I made with a team of students at my university. 
    				We were instructed to use RenPy, an engine commonly used for dating simulator games. 
    				I brainstormed the main idea of the game, which was to have a timer that never stopped, even if the game was paused. 
    				We wanted to try and use the engine to make a game that it was not specifically designed to make. 
    				I was the programmer in our team and coded the entire game. 
    				The main challenges I faced when coding the game was trying to keep the timer running between the areas in the game. 
    				Even more challenging was coding in 3 time areas where the people in the game would move around the world and have different dialogues and interactions.
