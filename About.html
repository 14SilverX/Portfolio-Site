    				Hello, my name is Alex Guerra, and welcome to my website coded from scratch using HTML!
    				Ever since the age of 8, I enjoyed using my technical knowledge to create fun and interactive media for my peers to enjoy. 
    				I am looking to work with a team to create games and media for a larger scale audience. 
    				I have also completed projects and conducted experiments using the HTC Vive in Unity 3D for the past year, 
    				so being able to work with the Vive in the future would also be appealing to me.

    				My mother loves the classic Zelda games. 
    				As a child, I would watch her play the NES and SNES every night. 
    				What was even more mesmerizing is when I get to watch my father play the old arcade cabinet games. 
    				With parents like these, I was easy to fall in love with video games. 
    				I wish I could have enjoyed school the same way. 
    				I remember at the age of 8, asking myself why school couldn't be enjoyable. 
    				What could I do to make it enjoyable? 
    				As elementary school students we only get specific days to control the class and those were presentation days. 
    				At that level, PowerPoint presentations were note cards for the students to read from as they presented their research to a class where less than half of the students were really paying attention. 
    				I decided that if we were stuck in a class, we should at least have fun while learning. 
    				I spent a week playing with PowerPoint to find out what I could do with it and how I could use it to make an enjoyable and memorable presentation. 
    				The result was a character named Stickman, who was a stickman drawn in Microsoft Paint. 
    				I would animate Stickman using PowerPoint animations to make him go on adventures depending on what I would have to report on. 
    				If the subject was the Civil War, colonial Stickman would run around avoiding getting shot by other stickmen. 
    				If the subject was about tornados, I would put Stickman's fate in the hands of the class, giving them choices on how Stickman should prepare for a tornado and accompanying animations for when they guessed wrong (because why wouldn't they). 
    				Seeing people enjoy my presentations and interacting with them made me feel proud and accomplished. 
    				I had made a class fun and had possibly made some students enjoy a class for once. 
    				Creating something for others to enjoy and watching them enjoy it is what makes me happy.
    			</li>
    			<p></p>
    			<li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 25px;">
    					I would continue to make engaging presentations, but I wanted to make something people could enjoy outside of the classroom; I wanted to make a computer game. 
    				After a failed attempt to recreate Pokemon in PowerPoint when I was 10, my mother introduced me to an animation program called Scratch. 
    				Using Scratch, I was able to make my first game called Secret Agent Stickman (as a tribute to Stickman from my PowerPoints) and send them to my friends to play and try to beat my high score. 
    				I also experimented with artificial intelligence using Scratch and still apply some of what I learned from using Scratch in the games I make today. 
    				Eventually my father found a book in the library which lead to me installing GameMaker 7 on my computer. 
    				Now I had a tool specifically made for developing games. 
    				Using GameMaker I would go on to start a game development club at my high school, start a YouTube channel for GameMaker tutorials (linked at the bottom of this page), conduct a formal research experiment on game development as my senior project, and construct a portfolio of GameMaker games to get accepted into the prestigious Worcester Polytechnic Institute. 
    				I knew I wanted to be involved in game development form a young age and it is my goal to make that dream a reality and make games for the world to enjoy.

    				The first thing you should know about me is that I like the color red. 
    				My typical casual attire is a red dry-fit shirt with black sweat pants. 
    				My friends love to pretend it is the end of the world if they catch me without any red on due to laundry day or when I am in more formal attire. 
    				When I am not working I enjoy a good game of billiards. 
    				At my university I founded the cue sports club there and stream our meetings and tournaments on another of my YouTube channels (linked at the bottom of the page). 
    				I am also an avid player of badminton and have played on an advanced level for about 8 years now. 
    				I also play Magic the Gathering with friends and sometimes competitively. 
    				I collect more than just Magic cards, however, I also have about 90 different decks of playing cards and know how to do some pretty cool card tricks. 
    				Some of the people I first met at college still call me Magic Alex. 
    				Finally, I like to make my own music. For my humanities requirement for college I took a lot of courses on music sequencing and electronic music composition. 
    				All of the more decent sounding songs are up on my third YouTube page under the name Paradox Media (linked below).
