    				The Conduit's Garden is a fourth-dimensional Japanese gardening game developed in Unity3D to work with the HTC Vive virtual reality platform. 
    				Players are given the role of a Shinto spiritual conduit tasked with caring for the bonsai trees, Koi ponds, and gravel pits in a fourth-dimensional Japanese garden to appease local nature spirits. 
    				As a spiritual conduit, players must work to create a stable balance between civilization and nature to appease the ancient nature spirits residing in the heart of Japan. 
    				In our game, a former temple worshipper who recently moved to Tokyo asks the conduit to visit his new home. 
    				By having the conduit tend to his rooftop garden, he hopes to fill his home with the energy of the spirits, or Kami, that thrived in the gardens of the conduit's temple. 
    				Keeping the garden's bonsai trees free of decay and pests, the koi ponds full of fat and happy fish, and the gravel pits filled with flowing designs will bring more Kami to the garden within the short time allowed by the client and fulfill the wishes an old friend to the temple.

    			<li style="list-style-type: none; line-height: 25px;">
    				This game was made in a lab in Osaka, Japan. 
    				I was responsible for setting up the framework for the fourth-dimension mechanic in our game. 
    				The code was made to turn any prefab object into a fourth-dimensional object by simply adding one or two scripts to the object. 
    				I was also the one who worked with the Vive to set it up and code it to work with our game objects. 
    				I also coded the fish and water objects in our game while also helping in the debugging of the bonsai and gravel pit objects. 
    				I also did a lot of performance tests and made changes to all the code to make the game run as smooth as possible for the best playing experience. 
    				The 4D demo video on this page depicts me using the Vive as I explain how the fourth dimension works in our game.
