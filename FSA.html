    				A large number of ships are approaching earth. Some of them are friendly, 
    				but others are trying to destroy the world! Using the musical scales as code, 
    				protect friendly ships that belong in the scale and destroy the other ships that do not. 
    				The more you know your scales, the better you can defend earth. 
    				Hitting a friendly ship will damage your space turret which is repaired at the start of every wave. 
    				However, any enemy ships that make it to earth will explode and permanently damage the planet. 
    				The scales change every wave to throw the enemy off, 
    				but they will start sending advanced ships that will be harder to hit. 
    				Good luck, you are earth's only hope against the Full Scale Attack!

    				This game was made in the summer of 2015 after I had received the LSAMP grant. 
    				I worked with one of my professors who owned the company Clear Blue Media. 
    				I worked under the company name Paradox Games, which was later renamed to Paradox Media. 
    				The concept was initially created by me then modified by my professor to the current design. 
    				All programming was done by me as well as the creation of the Full Scale Attack title screen logo. 
    				The font, planets and space ships were all purchased and/or downloaded from online and the Unity asset store. 
    				Two version of the game were built: An HTML5 version and an Apple mobile device version. 
    				With the mobile version I used Xcode to package and deploy the game to the app store under my professor's developer license.
    				All music was created by my professor, Vincent Manzo.
